Project 4 Pseudocode Main

BrendanBassettJonathanGrant_04 Class
Declare string variable for the file name.
Declare private string variable constants INPUT_FILE and OUTPUT_FILE.
Declare two List objects for Students and GradeItems.

main method.
Define main method header with args String array argument.
Declare string variable for the file numbers.
Instantiate the list arrays for Student and GradeItem objects.
Print the program header.
Iteratively process each INPUT_FILE by file number and call the processInput method.
Generate a report using a method for each INPUT_FILE.
Print the report and write it to an OUT_FILE that corresponds to its INPUT_FILE.
Clear the Student and GradeItem lists for next INPUT_FILE.

processInput method.
Open input file, displaying error message if file is not found.
Read data lines.
Call split method to parse the line to a String array of fields.
If first field of the array is Student, call the processStudentData method and pass the array.
If first field of the array is Student, call the processGradeItemData method and pass the array.

Process Student Data Method

Define processStudentData method header with info String array argument.

If second field of the String array is add, call Student constructor on line of fields.
Use equals method on Student objects of list array for students to find a duplicate.
If there is a duplicate student, display error message that includes Student ID.
If there is no duplicate student, add new student object to list with the add method.

If second field of the String array is del, then call Student constructor on line of fields.
Call the remove method to remove instance of Student from the list arrays.
Check return of remove method.
If no entry found, display message using err stream.

Catch exceptions thrown by Student constructor and display message using err stream.
If the second field is neither add nor del, display error message saying so with the second field.

Process Grade Item Data Method

Define processGradeItemData method header with info String array argument.

If second field of the String array is add, call GradeItem constructor on line of fields.
Use equals method on GradeItem objects of list array for students to find a duplicate.
If there is a duplicate GradeItem, display error message with Student ID and GradeItem ID.
If there is no duplicate GradeItem, add new GradeItem object to list with the add method.

If second field of the String array is del, then call GradeItem constructor on line of fields.
Call the remove method to remove instance of GradeItem from the list arrays.
Check return of remove method.
If no entry found, display message using err stream.

Catch exceptions thrown by GradeItem constructor and display message using err stream.
If the second field is neither add nor del, display error message saying so with the second field.

Generate Report Method

Define generateReport method header.
Call toArray method on list of Student objects.
Call toArray method on list of GradeItem objects.
Open a new file with specified name or create it.
For each Student in the Student list, search the GradeItem list by matching Student Ids, and
write the information to the open file and print to console.
